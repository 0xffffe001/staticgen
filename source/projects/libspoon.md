### Why is `libspoon` better than the others?

Firstly of all it is written in `Bash`, a program everyone has, hence you do not have to install anything.
Secondly, it is a library which means you can implement it however you want.

### When to use Boagen?

If you want to run an automated blog post render script then you can use `libspoon` to render the file in a directory of `.post` file and output the rendered files (configured within the `.post` file as `outputFile`) to a `posts/` directory.
