Blended is a command line tool that helps you easily create HTML websites by mimicing the templating system used by PHP and WordPress. Blended is able to build from HTML, Markdown, Textile (.tile) and Plain Text (.txt) source files at the same time.

Blended supports interactive (on file change) building as well as a standard build command. Websites created using Blended are easy to manage and deploy.
